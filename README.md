# CatorDogMachineLearningImageClassifierProject
Created and analyzed a machine learning project for determining if an image is a picture of a dog or of a cat. 1,170 images 
from the Kaggle data set were used for feature selection performed by a pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network to create a
Cosine K-Nearest Neighbor classifier and a Cubic Support Vector Machine classifier. 25,000 images were then used for a second 
feature selection to create another Cubic Support Vector Machine since it was the better performing classifier. The entire machine 
learning workflow was performed including partitioning the data, feature selection, classifier selection, training, cross-validation 
and testing. The MATLAB Classification Learner App was used to help create the classifiers. This project was performed by two partners
and myself for my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence elective course (CAP4630).
